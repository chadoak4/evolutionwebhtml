    <h1>The Evolution of the Web</h1>
    <br> The evolution of web design has come along way since the early days of the computer.
    <br>In the beginning, web design was very basic in form of design using a black screen with
    <br>only a few monochrome pixels in the year of 1989. In the later 1990’s web design began
    <br>to evolve. This was the era we were introduced to the web browser, JavaScript and Flash.
    <br>It was then that we began to question whether developers should learn design and designers
    <br>learn to code due to the small complications each of these presented. Since then,
    <br>technology is only becoming stronger and is allowing us to create a more friendly experience
    <br>for both the developers and the users. Technology is only going to continue to improve and
    <br>it’s important that both design and the program work together to perform the highest
    <br>quality end result for the user.
